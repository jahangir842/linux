*******************************************************************
What is Hadoop?
*******************************************************************
Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large-scale datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. It emerged as a solution to the challenges posed by big data, where traditional data processing systems struggled to handle the volume, variety, and velocity of data generated in modern environments.
*******************************************************************
Core Components of Hadoop:
*******************************************************************
1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):
   - HDFS is the primary storage system in Hadoop.
   - It provides high-throughput access to data and ensures fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes in the cluster.
   - HDFS is optimized for handling large files and is suitable for batch processing workloads.
*******************************************************************
2. Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN):
   - YARN is the resource management and job scheduling component of Hadoop.
   - It allocates resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to applications running on the cluster and manages their execution.
   - YARN supports multiple processing engines, allowing users to run MapReduce, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and other frameworks on the same cluster.
*******************************************************************
Key Concepts and Features:
*******************************************************************
1. Scalability:
   - Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally by adding more commodity hardware to the cluster.
   - It can handle petabytes of data and thousands of nodes, making it suitable for large-scale data processing.
*******************************************************************
2. Fault Tolerance:
   - Hadoop ensures fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes in the cluster.
   - If a node fails, Hadoop automatically redirects tasks to other healthy nodes with replicated data, ensuring uninterrupted processing.
*******************************************************************
3. Data Locality:
   - Hadoop emphasizes data locality, which means processing tasks are executed on nodes where the data resides.
   - This reduces network overhead and improves performance by minimizing data transfer across the cluster.
*******************************************************************
4. MapReduce Paradigm:
   - MapReduce is a programming model and processing engine in Hadoop for parallel data processing.
   - It follows a two-step paradigm: the Map phase processes input data in parallel, and the Reduce phase aggregates and combines the results.
   - MapReduce is suitable for batch processing tasks but may not be ideal for iterative or interactive computations.
*******************************************************************
5. Ecosystem of Tools:
   - Hadoop has a rich ecosystem of tools and frameworks that extend its capabilities.
   - Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark, Apache HBase, Apache Kafka, and Apache Sqoop are some examples of tools integrated with Hadoop for data storage, processing, analytics, and integration.
*******************************************************************
Use Cases:
1. Big Data Analytics:
   - Hadoop is widely used for processing and analyzing large volumes of data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.
   - It is used in industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, telecommunications, and social media for various analytics tasks.
*******************************************************************
2. Data Warehousing:
   - Hadoop, combined with tools like Apache Hive and Apache HBase, can serve as a cost-effective platform for storing and querying structured and semi-structured data in a data warehouse environment.
*******************************************************************
3. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
   - Hadoop is used for ETL operations, where data is extracted from multiple sources, transformed into a suitable format, and loaded into data stores or analytical systems.
*******************************************************************
4. Log Processing and Monitoring:
   - Hadoop is employed for analyzing large volumes of log data generated by servers, applications, and devices to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.
*******************************************************************
Advantages of Hadoop:
*******************************************************************
1. Scalability: Hadoop can scale to handle massive amounts of data by adding more nodes to the cluster.
2. Cost-Effective: It leverages commodity hardware, making it cost-effective compared to traditional storage and processing systems.
3. Fault Tolerance: Hadoop's fault tolerance mechanisms ensure data availability and job continuity even in the presence of node failures.

			Hadoop HDFS Setup
*******************************************************************
Setting up resilience through data replication in an Apache Spark cluster typically involves configuring the underlying distributed storage system, such as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), to ensure data redundancy and fault tolerance. Spark relies on these systems to provide data resilience, as Spark itself does not manage data replication directly.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve resilience through data replication:
*******************************************************************

Set Up a Distributed Storage System

Install Hadoop on your cluster nodes. This includes setting up the HDFS component.
*******************************************************************
On each node, download and extract Hadoop
wget http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.0/hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz
mv hadoop-3.3.0 /usr/local/hadoop
*******************************************************************
Configure HDFS to enable replication. Edit the `hdfs-site.xml` file on each node:
*******************************************************************

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.replication</name>
    <value>3</value> <!-- This sets the replication factor to 3 -->
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>file:///usr/local/hadoop/hdfs/namenode</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
    <value>file:///usr/local/hadoop/hdfs/datanode</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
*******************************************************************
Start HDFS
Format the NameNode (only once) and start HDFS:
*******************************************************************
hdfs namenode -format
*******************************************************************
Start HDFS
start-dfs.sh
*******************************************************************

Configure Spark to Use HDFS

Ensure that Spark is configured to use HDFS as its storage layer. In the `spark-defaults.conf` file, specify the HDFS URI:

*******************************************************************
spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:9000
*******************************************************************

Store Data in HDFS

When you load or save data in Spark, use the HDFS URI to ensure that data is stored in the resilient, replicated storage layer.

*******************************************************************
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("ExampleApp") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read data from HDFS
df = spark.read.csv("hdfs://namenode:9000/user/hadoop/input.csv")

# Perform some transformations
df_transformed = df.filter(df['value'] > 100)

# Write data back to HDFS
df_transformed.write.csv("hdfs://namenode:9000/user/hadoop/output")
*******************************************************************

Monitor and Manage Replication

HDFS automatically manages data replication based on the replication factor set in the configuration. However, you can manually manage replication using HDFS commands if needed:

*******************************************************************
Change replication factor of a specific file
hdfs dfs -setrep -w 3 /user/hadoop/input.csv
*******************************************************************
Verify the replication factor
hdfs dfs -stat %r /user/hadoop/input.csv
*******************************************************************

Ensure Spark Fault Tolerance

Spark also provides fault tolerance for its computations through lineage information. If a node fails, Spark can recompute lost partitions of data based on the transformations applied to the original data. To further enhance resilience, you can checkpoint RDDs to HDFS:
*******************************************************************
# Enable checkpointing
spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("hdfs://namenode:9000/user/hadoop/checkpoints")

# Create an RDD
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform some transformations
rdd_transformed = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)

# Checkpoint the RDD
rdd_transformed.checkpoint()

# Action to trigger the checkpoint
rdd_transformed.collect()
*******************************************************************
Summary
*******************************************************************
By setting up and configuring HDFS with a replication factor, you ensure that data stored in HDFS is resilient and fault-tolerant. Spark leverages this underlying storage system to provide robust data processing capabilities. Additionally, Spark's built-in fault tolerance for computations, coupled with data checkpointing, further enhances resilience in a distributed environment.
