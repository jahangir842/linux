### Disk Space Usage Commands in Linux

#### `df -T /`
The `df` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display information about the file system disk space usage. The `-T` option provides details about the type of each file system.

**Example Command:**
```sh
df -T /
```

**Example Output:**
```sh
Filesystem     Type  1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      ext4  102400000  6000000  91200000   7% /
```

**Explanation of Output Columns:**
- **Filesystem**: The name of the file system (e.g., `/dev/sda1`).
- **Type**: The type of the file system (e.g., `ext4`).
- **1K-blocks**: The total size of the file system in 1K blocks.
- **Used**: The amount of space used in 1K blocks.
- **Available**: The amount of space available in 1K blocks.
- **Use%**: The percentage of space used.
- **Mounted on**: The mount point of the file system (e.g., `/`).

#### Checking Only the Percentage Used

If you want to check only the percentage of disk space used for the root directory (`/`), you can use a combination of commands.

**Using `awk`:**
```sh
df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'
```

**Explanation:**
- `df -h /`: Displays disk space usage for the root directory in a human-readable format.
- `awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'`: Extracts the percentage of used disk space from the second row, fifth column.

**Example Output:**
```sh
7%
```

**Without `awk` (using `grep` and `cut`):**
```sh
df -h / | grep '/' | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5
```

**Explanation:**
- `df -h /`: Displays disk space usage for the root directory in a human-readable format.
- `grep '/'`: Filters the output to include only the line containing the root directory.
- `tr -s ' '`: Translates sequences of spaces into a single space.
- `cut -d ' ' -f 5`: Splits the line by spaces and selects the fifth field, which is the percentage of used disk space.

**Example Output:**
```sh
7%
```
