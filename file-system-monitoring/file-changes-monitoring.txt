In Ubuntu (or any Linux-based system), there are several methods to determine if files have been changed or edited in the filesystem. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Using `find` Command**:
   The `find` command can be used to search for files based on their modification time. For example, to find files modified in the last 24 hours:
   ```bash
   find /path/to/directory -type f -mtime -1
   ```
   - `/path/to/directory` is the directory you want to search in.
   - `-type f` restricts the search to files (not directories).
   - `-mtime -1` means modified within the last day.

2. **Using `inotify` Tools**:
   `inotify` is a powerful tool for monitoring filesystem events. `inotifywait` can be used to watch for changes in real-time. Install `inotify-tools` if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
   ```
   Example usage to monitor changes in a directory:
   ```bash
   inotifywait -m /path/to/directory
   ```
   The `-m` option means the command will keep running and print events as they occur.

3. **Using `auditd` (Audit Daemon)**:
   `auditd` is a comprehensive auditing system for Linux. You can set up rules to monitor changes to specific files or directories. Install `auditd` if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install auditd
   ```
   Example to monitor changes to `/path/to/directory`:
   ```bash
   sudo auditctl -w /path/to/directory -p wa -k directory_changes
   ```
   - `-w /path/to/directory` sets the watch on the directory.
   - `-p wa` means watch for write (`w`) and attribute change (`a`) events.
   - `-k directory_changes` is a key to identify this specific audit rule.

   To view audit logs:
   ```bash
   sudo ausearch -k directory_changes
   ```

4. **Using `stat` Command**:
   The `stat` command can be used to check the modification time of individual files:
   ```bash
   stat /path/to/file
   ```

5. **Using Git for Version Control**:
   If you are dealing with source code or text files, using Git can be very effective. Initialize a Git repository and commit your files:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   Later, you can check the status of the repository to see if any files have been changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

### Example Scenarios

1. **Finding Recently Modified Files**:
   ```bash
   find /var/www -type f -mtime -1
   ```
   This will list all files in the `/var/www` directory that were modified in the last 24 hours.

2. **Monitoring a Directory for Changes**:
   ```bash
   inotifywait -m /home/user/Documents
   ```
   This command will keep running and print out any changes occurring in the `/home/user/Documents` directory.

3. **Auditing Changes to a Directory**:
   ```bash
   sudo auditctl -w /etc -p wa -k etc_changes
   sudo ausearch -k etc_changes
   ```
   This will monitor the `/etc` directory for changes and list them when you run the `ausearch` command.

Choose the method that best suits your needs based on the granularity and real-time requirements of your monitoring.
