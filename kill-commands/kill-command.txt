 kill is a tool used to send signals to processes. Signals are a form of inter-process communication.

        Common Signals
********************************
Signals are used to control processes in various ways. Each signal has a name and a corresponding number. Here are some of the most commonly used signals:

    SIGTERM (15): Default signal sent by kill. Requests the process to terminate gracefully.
    SIGKILL (9): Forces the process to terminate immediately. The process cannot catch or ignore this signal.
    SIGHUP (1): Hangs up the process. Often used to reload configuration files.
    SIGINT (2): Interrupts the process, typically sent when you press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
    SIGQUIT (3): Quits the process and produces a core dump, typically sent when you press Ctrl+.
    SIGSTOP (19): Stops (pauses) the process. The process cannot catch or ignore this signal.
    SIGCONT (18): Continues a stopped process.
