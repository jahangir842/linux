Netplan is the default network configuration utility in recent versions of Ubuntu (starting from Ubuntu 17.10). Therefore, it should already be installed on your system if you are using a supported version of Ubuntu Server. However, if for some reason Netplan is not installed or you need to reinstall it, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Update Package Lists

First, update the package lists to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install Netplan

Install the Netplan package using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install netplan.io
```

### 3. Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that Netplan is installed and check its version:

```bash
netplan --version
```

This should output something like `netplan 0.99` or higher, depending on the version available in your repository.

### 4. Configure Network

Once Netplan is installed, you can create or modify the Netplan configuration files located in `/etc/netplan/`. These files typically have a `.yaml` extension.

For example, you might have a configuration file named `01-netcfg.yaml`. You can edit it with a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

Here's an example configuration for setting a static IP address:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.20/24
      routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.1.1
          metric: 100
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8.8.8
          - 8.8.4.4
```

After editing the configuration file, apply the changes:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues or need to debug your network configuration, you can use the following commands:

- Check the status of network devices:

  ```bash
  ip addr
  ```

- Check the routing table:

  ```bash
  ip route
  ```

- Validate the Netplan configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo netplan try
  ```

  This command temporarily applies the configuration and allows you to revert it if something goes wrong.

With these steps, you should be able to install, configure, and troubleshoot Netplan on your Ubuntu Server.
