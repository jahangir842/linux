for checking which tool is being used in a system:

systemctl status systemd-networkd
systemctl status NetworkManager
systemctl status netplan

ps aux | grep -E 'systemd-networkd|NetworkManager|netplan'

Inspect Network Configuration Files:
        /etc/systemd/network/: Configuration files for systemd-networkd.
        /etc/netplan/: YAML configuration files for Netplan.
        /etc/NetworkManager/: Configuration files for NetworkManager.


Network Configuration Utilities:

    Run utility commands specific to each network tool to see their status or configurations:
        For systemd-networkd: networkctl status
        For NetworkManager: nmcli general status
        For Netplan: netplan --debug generate

For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), edit /etc/network/interfaces:
For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora), edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:
Create or modify a network configuration file for the interface, e.g., /etc/systemd/network/10-static-en.network:
Edit the netplan configuration file, e.g., /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml:

Networkd vs network manager  vs netplan 

systemd-networkd (Networkd):
	Used to manage network configurations at a low level.Ideal for servers and headless systems.


NetworkManager:
    NetworkManager is a more advanced and feature-rich network management tool suitable for desktops and laptops.
    
   
Netplan:

    Netplan is a YAML-based network configuration tool introduced in Ubuntu 17.10 and later versions.
    view the contents of the Netplan configuration file and look for the renderer key to determine
    which backend tool is being used by Netplan. netplan points to /usr/sbin/netplan, it's clear that Netplan itself 
    is installed and functioning as expected. The absence of a netplan.service in systemctl is because Netplan is not 
    a standalone service but rather a configuration tool that generates files for the network management services 
    (like systemd-networkd or NetworkManager) to apply.
