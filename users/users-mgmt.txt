When to Use kill -9

Unresponsive Processes: When a process does not respond to the default SIGTERM signal or other termination requests and needs to be forcefully stopped.

Stubborn Processes: For processes that refuse to terminate due to bugs or other issues.

Understanding kill -9

    kill Command: The kill command is used to send signals to processes. By default, it sends the SIGTERM signal, which requests the process to terminate gracefully, allowing it to clean up resources (like closing files, releasing memory, etc.).

    -9 Option: The -9 option specifies the SIGKILL signal. SIGKILL (signal number 9) cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored by the process. It forces the operating system to immediately stop the process.
